Beginner Test
1.	The class of object is a data frame.  This was found using â€œclass(mtcars).
2.	Precip is defined as a 1-dimensional array since there is one data point per city.
3.	As function, make a new matrix from tree data using an array.
4.	Atlanta is the name of the 14th city in the precip dataset.
5.	Use data frame
6.	Precip does contain numeric data.  Math functions can be applied to the dataset.
7.	Mtcars(multiarray)[2,7], mtcars(multiarray)[ [2,qsec], mtcars(multiarray)[ [Mazda RX4 Wag,7] mtcars(multiarray)[ [Mazda RX4 Wag,qsec]
8.	subscripts
9.	There are no trees with the girl greater than volume.  This was tested using "Girth">"Volume" which came out with false
Intermediate Test
1.	The number 7 shows up 11 times.
2.	apply(MyMatrix,2,sum)
3.	apply(MyMatrix,2,prod)
4.	tapply(MyMatrix[12])
5.	which(apply(MyMatrix,1,sum) > 3), which(apply(MyMatrix,1,sum) < 8)
6.	

Expert Test
1.	mean(precip), median(precip), sd(precip)
2.	barplot since it shows much more data.
3.	
4.	
5.	Yes, you can look at the stats.
