Cenozoic latitudinal response curves: individualistic changes in the latitudinal distributions of marine bivalves and gastropods by Andrew Zaffos and Arnold Miller

Article Summary
This article is about the occurrences of bivalves in during the Miocene and Pleistocene and how their latitudinal distributions varied and changed.  It addresses whether or not there are any latitudinal migrations and whether the movements were caused by geologic events.  Response curves of the bivalve and gastropod distributions were used to look at latitudinal tolerance.  The article then has a blank page (accident?) and goes on to talk about observed changes in the parameters and if they are smaller or larger than expected.  After this comes the data selection.  The data is of marine bivalve and gastropod genera from the PaleoDB and is organized by Cenozoic epoch and stage.  This represents 2958 genera and 124,701 occurrences.  Latitudinal binning is used from 0.1 degrees to 10 degrees bins.  The article proceeds to talk about model accuracy since it has been questioned in the past.  It uses canonical correspondence analysis to estimate the genus’s preferred latitude.  CCA is a multivariate ordination technique, correspondence analysis.  The results use distributions along hollow curves that show smaller changes more common than larger ones.  After this are 2 blank pages.  Results find that marine genera are more likely to shift towards the center of a distribution.  Marine bivalve genera were shown to expand away from the tropics via “bridge species” that originate in the tropics and expand their range. Conclusion found no long-term trend of poleward or equatorward shifts in the latitudinal distribution of marine genera.

What I liked 
The topic of this article was interesting.  I was unaware that it could be determined whether bivalves migrated over time using data such as this.  The conclusion was written very well.  It was very concise and made it very easy to determine what the authors decided at the end of the study.  I also liked that they addressed the model- due to the questioning of its accuracy in the past.

What I didn’t like
There were a few instances of white pages that were gaps in the article.  I am not sure if this was intended, but when loaded multiple times, this was how the article appeared.  This led to some missing information and detracted from the understanding of the article.  A graphic showing a map of potential migrations would have been helpful.

Tables/Graphs
There was only one table, and it showed the mean of the differences and bootstrapped mean for the data.  It was along intervals of various time periods.  I was not sure why almost all of the p-values were 0, did this mean that the findings had absolutely no latitudinal change, or just that it was very likely the results were accurate.  It did not break the data down into genera, or separate it for bivalves and gastropods.
