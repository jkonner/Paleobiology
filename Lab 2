Lab 2

1.	I have determined that there are 4 species based on morphology- looking at size and shape (presence of ridges).  Only 5 organisms had the ridges and this made up one species.  To determine which species was which, I looked at the umbilical to diameter ratio and the width to diameter ratio.
Species 1: 1,8,11,20,21
Species 2: 2,6,12,14,18,23,24
Species 3:9,10,13,19,25
Species 4:3,4,5,7,15,16,17,22
2.	There are two morphological features that stand out.  One is qualitative and the other is quantitative.  Some of the Ammonites have ridges in the shells, while most do not.  The second morphological characteristic that was looked at was the size.  Sexual dimorphism occurs in ammonites, where the females are larger, possibly due to carrying eggs.  So size is not a hard rule when distinguishing species since members of the same species can vary in size across sexes.
3.	I would speculate that a number of the specimens are young individuals that undergo ontogenetic change since WD ratio is much higher relative to the UD ratio for the smaller organisms.
4.	Sexual dimorphism is possible but unlikely due to the dimension ratios between species.
Part 2 Questions
1.	Land, links, species, site, outline
2.	Function
3.	The dimensions of the first object are from 1 to 960
Part 3
1.	The object “land” records the list in the landmark data.
2.	ProcrustesHummingbird<-gpagen(hummingbirds[["land"]])
3.	plotTangentSpace(ProcrustesHummingbird[["coords"]],warpgrids=FALSE,verbose=FALSE)
4.	There are 25 species of Hummingbird.
Part 4
1.	Fans longer than 6 inches
2.	Sulfurous odor
3.	Adorable eyelashes
4.	The taxa including C,D,E
5.	Species E has a laser death ray
6.	Adorable eyelashes are a synapomorphy for A and B
7.	Family 1 is monophyletic, Family 2 is paraphyletic and Family 3 is polyphyletic
1.	 This is not advisable since there are species more closely related to D and E than A.  This means it is more likely species C should be grouped in that family
2.	Group 1 is polyphyletic, Group 2 is monophyletic, Group 3 is paraphyletic, Group 4 is monophyletic, Group 5 is paraphyletic.
Part 4
1.	Gryphaea mccullochi underwent peramorphosis and Gryphaea gigantean underwent paedomorphosis.
2.	Gryphaea gigantea has underwent more heterochrony, since it resembles a full juvenile, while the other species appears more like an intermediate stage one.
3.	This is an example of paedomorphosis.
